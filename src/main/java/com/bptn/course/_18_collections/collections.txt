COLLECTIONS
***********

Definition:

A Java Collection is a data structure.

A Data Structure, is data organized in a particular way plus a set operations such as read, 
insert, update, delete, sort, etc, to perform on these data.  

Generally speaking, there is no such thing as the best data structure,
but specific data structures perform better than others, depending on the situation.

A Java Collection is comprised of objects of the same type (same as in Arrays)

 Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."

 
LISTS
*****

- Keep the insertion order
- Accepts duplicates


- Types

1. ArrayList:
   - Backed by Arrays
   - Java creates a new internal Array to hold elements if more space is needed.
   - Are faster (elements in sequence)
   - Perform better than LinkedList if we don't need to modify a long list frequently (insert, remove).

2. LinkedList
   - Double linked chain of nodes.
   - Are slower (double links)
   - Perform better than ArrayList if we need to modify a long list frequently (insert, remove).
